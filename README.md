# cnn-rnn-gesture-recognition
This project aims to develop a gesture recognition feature for smart TVs that allows users to control the device without a remote. Using a dataset of categorized videos, the model will recognize five gestures: thumbs up, thumbs down, left swipe, right swipe, and stop, translating them into corresponding commands.
